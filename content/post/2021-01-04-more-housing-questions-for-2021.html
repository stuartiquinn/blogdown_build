<h3>More Housing Questions Than Answers….</h3>
<p>What better time than the New Year to take in a longer gaze (both backward and forwards)? Rather than giving a new take or angle on excessively gamed scenarios such as the U.S. Elections or Covid-19, I’ll raise a couple of 21st century structural questions in housing that I am yet to find a compelling response to. For now, just more questions than answers.</p>

<h4>Questions: positive view v. negative view with graphs</h4>
<p><strong>1. What does the composition of the age demographics of the population mean for housing going forward?</strong></p>
<p><strong>+</strong> <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/28/millennials-overtake-baby-boomers-as-americas-largest-generation/">Millennial’s</a>, particularly those children of the baby boom era continue to suggest ongoing high demand for new home purchases. Those aged 27 as of 2018 (i.e. presently 29) are 4.81 million individuals who will continue to drive demand as they form households and look to purchase homes (if they have not already). As of 2019, the median age of first-time home buyers (FTHB) is estimated to be 33 by the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-08/young-homebuyers-vanish-from-u-s-as-median-purchasing-age-jumps">National Association of Realtors (NAR)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> Despite this demographic tailwind, first-time home buyers (FTHB) continue to remain lower than expected relative to demand (see more below)</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> The pandemic and <a href="https://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2020/12/update-framing-lumber-prices-up-50-year.html">higher costs to build</a> is likely to continue to put negative pressure on prospective entrants to the purchase market.</p>

<p><strong>2. What does the secular trend in declining mobility within the U.S. mean for the future of owner-occupied housing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>+</strong> Mobility and movement creates the opporutnity for more transactions of new and existing home sales. Demographic trends may provide a positive impact to this trend as:
1. Younger generations coming of age (28-35 year old’s) consider moves from cities to suburbs for lifestyle reasons (better school district, more affordable cost/sq. ft. for growing families, etc.) or reduction in usage of amenities (under pandemic conditions or otherwise)
2. Likewise, older generations (baby-boomers) may downsize as children leave the home, maintenance and accessibility are not accommodating to their age or retirement enables a desired move (e.g. to warmer climates).</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> Increased remote work and digitally enabled careers further reduces the proportion of the population needing to relocate for work</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> Low inventory in homes available for sale make the prospects or interest of moving less desirable when purchaser’s feel they would be over-stretched financially and hold out until more listings are available.</p>
<p>In the event mortgage rates begin to rise, those with existing mortgages have a further disincentive to move if they have capitalized on historic lows in mortgage rates.</p>

<p><strong>3. How many people will be priced out if mortgage finance rates begin to elevate?</strong></p>
<p>The post Great Recession period of low interest rates has been beneficial to housing, particularly existing mortgage holders eligible for refinancing. However, many have not been able to capitalize on the more affordable rates due to economic factors (unemployment during the Great Recession or Covid-19). In recent years, increased home prices and <a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/cost-burdens-rise-middle-income-households-most-metros">soaring rents</a> likely contributed in diminishing the benefits of low rates contribution to mortgage affordability.</p>

<p><strong>4. Will the proportion of first-time home buyers (FTHB) increase in-line with demographic trends?</strong></p>
<p><strong>+</strong> Given the positive demographic trends and lower rate environment – a future increase in available inventory of homes for sale could quickly lead to strong demand for new first-time home buyers.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> As expected, the rate shrunk after the Great Recession, yet the sustained lower proportion of first-time home buyers has persisted longer than expected.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> Economic uncertainty under Covid-19 has the potential to further stem growth and home-purchases by new entrants.</p>
