<h3>A Growth Strategy Evolution</h3>
<p>Last week the Seattle Planning Commission released an interim white paper titled <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/SeattlePlanningCommission/SPC%20Growth%20Strategy%20White%20Paper%201072020(0).pdf" title="Evolving Seattle&#39;s Growth Strategy">Evolving Seattle’s Growth Strategy</a> – foreshadowing their updates to the Commission’s revised Comprehensive Plan due in 2023.</p>
<p>The white paper, builds off the foundation <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/OPCD/OngoingInitiatives/SeattlesComprehensivePlan/FinalGrowthandEquityAnalysis.pdf" title="Growth and Equity">Seattle 2035 - Growth and Equity report (May, 2016)</a> and the Commissions most recent <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/SeattlePlanningCommission/SPCNeighborhoodsForAllFINALdigital2.pdf" title="Neighborhoods for All">Neighborhoods for All</a> reports.</p>

<h4>A Quick Background</h4>
<p><strong>The Planning Commission</strong></p>
<p><em>The Seattle Planning Commission is an independent, 16-member advisory body
appointed by the Mayor, City Council, and the Commission itself. The members of
the Commission are volunteers who bring a wide array of expertise and a diversity
of perspectives to these roles.</em></p>

<p>A RESOLUTION affirming the City’s race and social justice work and directing City Departments to use available tools to assist in the elimination of racial and social disparities across key indicators of success, including health, education, criminal justice, the environment, employment and the economy; and to promote equity within the City workplace and in the delivery of City services.</p>

&gt;A RESOLUTION confirming that the City of Seattle’s core value of race and social equity is one of the foundations on which the Comprehensive Plan is built</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The city of Seattle realized early on the potential dark sides of urban growth and attempted to provide thoughtful forward planning through a set of strategic and policy remedies that could potentially stem the strain on current and future residents.Though there are many contributing factors to the cities rapid growth (for instance the beautiful natural amenities, temperate climate, etc.), the reality likely resides more so within the expansion of the technology sector and gainful employment. Amazon company growth and signaling in 2017 of targeting 100,000 new hires, coupled with unaffordable housing conditions in nearby San Francisco likely increased in-migration to the city of Seattle.</p>

<h3>Net Migration for King County</h3>
<p>Using the wonderful R package tidycensus, we’ll quickly take a look at annual migration growth for King County, WA (of which Seattle is a part of) with a few lines of code. In addition, we’ll quickly compare the population distributions by race between 2010 and 2018. <strong>Note:</strong> A <a href="https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html" title="tidycensus API detail">U.S. Census api key</a> is required to use tidycensus.</p>
<p>The majority of the data is self-contained within the tidycensus::get_estimates wrapper calling the API, but we’ll add a few extra steps simply for describing the categories pulled down. As usual, we’ll be utilizing tidyverse (stringr, ggplot2, dplyr, rvest) and the scales package for consuming and plotting the data below.</p>

<p>We can quickly see that King County (of which Seattle is a part of), has a couple of outstanding trends – a highly homogeneous population (predominately White) and large net in-migration growth (hence the city planning).</p>

<h3>Conclusion and Next Steps</h3>
<p>We see there is clearly a looming problem, in a future post we’ll use our combination of tidycensus along with sf (simple features) and leaflet package to recreate some of the maps contained within the updates to track progress of the 2035 plan to date based on the most recent report…</p>
