<h3>TidyTuesday Week 7 - 2021</h3>
<p>I was excited to see the <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-02-09/readme.md">week 7 TidyTuesday (tt) data</a> was from <a href="https://www.urban.org/">The Urban Institute</a>, which is a prominent leftward leaning think tank in Washington D.C. Though seemingly everything can be partisan these days, the Urban Institute continues to produce data rich contributions to provide informative policy recommendations. In addition, the organization is highly transparent in their methods and the data used, which in turn enables other researchers and data users. Readers will find the institute’s <a href="https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/housing-finance-policy-center">Housing Finance Policy Center</a> serves as inspiration for a number of previous posts on housing finance.</p>
<p>The TidyTuesday data spans a number of different data sets relating to wealth and income across demographic groups over time (Urban Institute App can be found <a href="https://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/">here</a>). For this post, I also bring in a secondary source of data from research conducted by Raj Chetty and the <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/">Opportuinty Insights</a> team, which helps illuminate how generations and status can impact future demographics.</p>
<p>Code and visual for both below – detailed notes on the data, sampling methods and sources can be found on the links provided above.</p>

<div id="conclusions" class="section level3">
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>Most of this data reiterates what has been widely known for some time – there has been existing (and continuing / growing) inequality within the United States across racial demographics. Despite this not being a new revelation to most, the amount of data available and new sources of combined data sets provides a way to quickly demonstrate the magnitude of these inequities through simple but profoundly powerful visuals.</p>
<p>The relationship to wealth achievement based on parental income levels is a massively important empirical contribution by the Opportunity Insight’s authors. I encourage readers to look at the organizations research which further addresses additional key questions at the forefront of equality policy debates.</p>
<p>Finally, we should take note of how influential wealth creation for Black Americans was in the lead up to the Great-Recession of 2007 and conversely, how detrimental the impact was in wealth destruction in years following. The data exemplifies the positive contribution home ownership can have on lifetime wealth, but also demonstrates the risks associated with the concentration of wealth in a single asset.</p>
